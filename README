This is an example of setting up a PSU search block for Drupal 7.

Its not an actual Drupal module.

There are three files.

 - search_block.css - The CSS for the block.
 - search_block_essp.html - The HTML to be entered into the block.
 - search_box.js - The Javascript file that does the searching.

This is entirely not the correct way to do this, but it works and was a quick fix
on a Saturday morning.

Improvements and/or modulization would be welcome additions.
