This is an example of setting up a PSU search block for Drupal 7.

Its not an actual Drupal module.

There are three files.

 - search_block.css - The CSS for the block.  This needs to be added to your theme's local.css file or some other method
 - search_block_essp.html - The HTML to be entered into the block.  This is copied into a Drupal block - I used PHP format.  Yes, I know this is very bad.
 	- You will need to change the path on the last line "/sites/all/themes/essp_pixture/js/search_box.js " to where you want to store the .js file.
 - search_box.js - The Javascript file that does the searching.  Find it a nice home in your theme, remember to fix the path above.

This is entirely not the correct way to do this, but it works and was a quick fix on a Saturday morning.

Improvements and/or modulization would be welcome additions.
